# First-CRUD-Project

First-CRUD-Project Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project with CRUD Operations in MySQL

This project, developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course, focused on implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a MySQL database. We utilized OOP principles to structure the code efficiently and modularly, ensuring an object-oriented approach to data manipulation.

The system allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of records in the database, showcasing the practical application of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism concepts learned throughout the course. The integration with MySQL adds a practical dimension to the development of object-oriented applications, providing a deeper understanding of the interactions between programming and database management.
